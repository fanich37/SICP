# ðŸŽ“ ðŸ“˜ A little Clojure in SICP
This repo has the only aim - finally try the [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) while reading the [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdfs). The tasks in the book are in [Scheme](http://www.scheme-reports.org/). I find it interesting to try more modern dialect of [Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org/).
